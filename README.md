  My name is Júlia Mateini, I studed one year of cybersecurity and I decided to change to Software engineering. Everyday I'm trying to learn more and more in the area that I choose, I love to talk to people to learn more and more! So if you want you can chat with me on instagram/LinkedIn. I want to be a developer and work with cybersecurity too, take some look at my projects, I think you will like it. <3
